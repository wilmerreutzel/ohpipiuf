                            <p> Hello, I'm relatively new to playing Geist the Sin Eaters, as I picked up the 1st Edition in anticipation of the upcoming 2nd Edition. The amount of Key + Manifestation combinations feel extremely expansive, and I am loving some of the combinations (Passion Boneyard, Stillness Shroud or Industrial Oracle, for example). While reading through the different Key + Manifestation combinations, I was confused by the Phantasm + Marionette set. The attributes of Strength, Dexterity, Stamina, Presence. With Geist 2E right around the corner (2 weeks ago it was listed in 2nd Proofing), I'm preparing the chronicle that I will be running for my Friday group. I would love any ideas you might have to help develop this chronicle and character creation. My base thoughts right now are the following: I want a game that isn't based in one locale. I would like the group to have means and motivation to travel, much like the TV show Supernatural. However, I would like those motivations Seeking (2) players to fill out an existing group for an upcoming Geist the Sin-Eaters 2nd Edition (when it’s released) weekly game on Fridays 6-9pm CST. This chronicle is set during the early 1980’s. Characters are Sin-Eaters (created with Geist 2nd Edition rule set) who work with a traveling carnival called the Midway Carnival. It travels the entirety of the United States over the course of a year, with one month spent in the Sonora Desert, as the governing family, the Conners, descendants. Do basically I'm a novice wanting to get into some of the WoD settings particularly Changling the Lost and Geist, but my irl life leaves me no time to play with an in person group (social anxiety doesn't help either) so I was hoping folks might know where online are good places to go for getting into this sort of thing. I have experience with play by post role playing and chat based scenes via discord and the like, but I've never played anything with a Stat system. So, long story short I've been a casual fan of the WoD settings for the better part of the last decade, but I've never had the opportunity to do more than skim through a few books and play VTM: Bloodlines. For the most part that was enough, as I moved frequently and thus could never get involved with a play group, nor do I even know where to start if I had the opportunity. Recently however a friend of mine gave me the PDFs for Geist and The Book of the Dead. I'd read bits of VTM and WTF years. EDIT : The actual document so far ( -------- Much as I love Geist , it has a lot of problems. Some--like the way the Krewe Channel completely remakes your Geist and you believe it was always secretly Santa Claus, as one person put it--are handwaved or ignored, the same way that Predator's Taint is often ignored. Other parts, unfortunately, are less about too much information and more about completely missing information. 
I know Geist is known to have a shaky launch and some mechanical issues, but I'm wondering if anyone could shed some light what exactly those issues are. Are the problems easily worked around or are their issues with the core ideas/mechanics of the splat? I'm looking to start a Geist Chronicle but would rather know what I'm getting myself into rather than find out in the middle of a session. So, I've ran the other races and what not, and to be honest, I haven't finished reading the whole book yet (reading a pdf that long gets tiring after a while, and my physical copy hasn't arrived yet), but the Sin-Eaters seem pretty neutral about everything. Sure, the players could perform an exorcism on every ghost causing problems, and that technically gives me a lot to work with, but I don't want the entire campaign about them just running around playing Ghost Busters (The movies are enterta. So I just recently received a copy of the Geist the Sin Eaters rulebook and I'm real excited to put it to use. I've been flipping through the book and I've looked at the Synergy chart a few times and read the section where it talks about what Synergy means. I just came to the conclusion that I just don't "get it," so I thought I would ask some questions. So, I "get" that Synergy is supposed to represent the unity between a geist and the Sin Eater, and that high Synergy means that a balance. Apply here: https://app.roll20.net/lfg/listing/97474/gtse-through-the-ebon-gate Sin-Eaters know that their strange existence is a complicated one. They stand at the crossroads between life and death and endure all the complications of both. But there are others, desperate for something to believe in, who believe that a Sin-Eater’s bond with her geist is a blessed state of unification and a triumph over the limitations of the human form. These souls make up the brethren of the Glorious Church. Ok, topic. We are playing a crossover campaign, and a friend who I like to torment is a Geist the SE. From barely skimming the rules, it seems like they are unkillable. However, I know they have to have a way to die written in the rules that I don't know about. So help me Reddit, how do I kill my friend? (in the game). 
So, I've started working on a campaign for Geist, and I have a lot of interesting things planned, but was a little annoyed by the fact that a lot of the "ghost story mystery" gets ruined by the Players basically automatically seeing the ghosts and what not. But I just read the first lines of Ghost Sight, and it says: "Sin-Eaters see ghosts as readily as they see the living, and can easily discern between the two. The ghost of a man that leapy in front of a subway train to commit suicide While playing a Geist chronicle (and reading the book) I had a strange feeling that "GtS-E" was written in a more "style over substance" way (be it intentional or due to deadlines and time constraints), as some impotant information is kinda unclear, especially info on titual Geists (and really, information-wise it should be called Sin-Eater: the Geist). It is not that I'm uncomfortable with coming up with my (and my fellow players') solutions for the game, it just would be better I am looking for players for a Geist: the Sin-Eaters chronicle set in Victorian Hampshire. Game is text-only, and will be played on a weekly basis in Roll20. Previous experience is not required, materials will be provided if necessary.

Hello Everyone! For a few weeks now I have been running a mystery stats game for Geist the Sin-Eaters for my group. It started out as a mystery CofD game and they have been slowly figuring out what game they are playing through hints and clues throughout the story. They have finally figured out that they are geists, and they have been receiving flashbacks of their, and their Geists, deaths at the hands of the big-bad for this chronicle. My question for all of you, now that they are figuring. So, I just got back into World of Darkness, and my friends own all of the primary books, but I personally only had the Werewolf: The Forsaken book, but I had bought that years ago. Unfortunately, I decided to buy the Vampire: The Requiem book a couple days ago when a friend informed me yesterday that everything was being revised with a second edition. Anyway, as the title suggests, I just got interest in Geist: The Sin-Eater a few days ago, and was going to buy a physical copy later tonight I vissa fall f rs kte barnets f der r dda sina barn, men deras liv stod nd inte att r dda, detta gjorde Olof Ersson, vilken f rs kte r dda sin son Anders.
